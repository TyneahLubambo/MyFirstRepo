# Brief introduction about myself

My name is Tyneah Lubambo, and I am an ambitious and dedicated learner currently enrolled in the ALX Software Engineering program. I live in Pretoria, South Africa, and I have a growing passion for technology and how it can be used to solve everyday challenges in society. Coming from a background where access to resources was not always easy, I’ve always been inspired to find ways to bring innovation and opportunity closer to underrepresented communities.

My tech journey started with curiosity — wondering how apps, websites, and digital tools work behind the scenes. Over time, that curiosity turned into a desire to learn how to build those tools myself. I’m especially interested in software development, data science, and creating digital solutions that improve education, agriculture, and access to information. I believe that technology, when used correctly, has the power to transform lives and create long-lasting impact.

In addition to my technical learning, I’m also passionate about personal growth, teamwork, and communication. I believe that being a great developer is not only about writing code but also about understanding real-world problems, listening to people’s needs, and working with others to build meaningful solutions. I am excited about the challenges ahead, and I am committed to putting in the work to grow both personally and professionally.

This repository marks an important step in my journey as a developer. It is my very first GitHub repository, created as part of my learning experience in the ALX program. I look forward to building many more projects and sharing my progress as I continue to grow in this exciting field.
