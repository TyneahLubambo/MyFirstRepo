# Brief introduction about myself
My name is Tyneah Marko. I’m an aspiring software developer and am currently on a journey to build digital skills in technology through the ALX program. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in areas such as food accessibility and job creation. I look forward to gaining hands-on experience, contributing to impactful projects, and growing as a developer through this opportunity.
